## 😄 Hi there 👋
My name is Faizal. <br>
An experienced software engineer with 5+ years of experience working in local and international <br>
companies currently focused on frontend and product things.

As a software engineer, I always love to see the big picture. By seeing how each component works <br>
and interacts with each other, I believe we can build an efficient/effective system. <br>
However, when it comes to implementation, the art of working parallel is solving the problem one by one. <br>
By prioritizing the problems, doing one thing at a time, and giving enough time (more effort now to save effort later), <br>
most items can be solved and avoid unexpected costs in the future.

I'm passionate about taking on new challenges and focusing on providing valuable and impactful products for society. <br>
I'm experienced working on fast pace startups, using Agile Methodologies, working remotely at <br>
different timezone, and being able to manage a small team. <br>
Also, a lifelong learner who can learn, share and adapt quickly. <br>
I love minimalism and open and honest culture, and In my spare time, I  love contributing to any Open Source projects.
