## 😄 Hi there 👋
My name is Faizal, an experienced software engineer with 4+ years of experience <br>
working in local and international companies which currently focused on frontend and product things.

As a software engineer, I always love to see the big picture. By seeing how each component works <br>
and interacts with each other, I believe we can build an efficient/effective system.

However, when it comes to implementation, I believe the art of working parallel is solving the problem one by one. <br>
By prioritizing the problems, doing one thing at a time, and giving enough time (more effort now to save effort later), <br>
most things can be solved and avoid unexpected costs in the future.

I'm experienced working on fast pace startups, using SCRUM/SCRUMBAN Methodology, <br>
working remotely at different timezone, and being able to manage a small team.

I'm also a lifelong learner who has the ability to learn, share and adapt quickly. <br>
Eager to face new challenges, and focuses on providing valuable and impactful products for society. <br>
I love minimalism, open and honest culture. And in my spare time, I love to contribute to any Open Source projects too.
