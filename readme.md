## 😄 Hi there 👋
Hi, my name is Faizal. <br>
A self-motivated software engineer with a demonstrated history of working in local and international companies for over half a decade. Currently focusing on frontend and product stuff.

As a software engineer, I always love to see the big picture. By seeing how each component works and interacts with each others, I believe we can build an efficient/effective system.
However, when it comes to implementation, the art of working parallel is solving problems one by one. By prioritizing the problems, doing one thing at a time, and giving enough time (more effort now to save effort later), most items can be solved and avoid unexpected costs in the future.

I have a million things running through my mind about how we can make the world a better place. Believes there's always complexity behind the simplicity and enjoys the process of simplifying it.
Also, I’m a lifelong learner who can adapt quickly, love an open and honest culture, and enjoy contributing to any Open Source project in my free time.
